Gas-Guzzler README
=======================

Gas Guzzler is an Android application that helps you store information after every trip to the pump. For every entry we store the price you paid, amount of gas purchased, and your odometer reading at that point. Gas Guzzler stores this data and uses it to provide you helpful statistics about your refill habits.
