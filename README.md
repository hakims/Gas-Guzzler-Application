Gas-Guzzler README
=======================

Gas Guzzler is an Android application that helps you store information after every trip to the pump. For every entry we store the price you paid, amount of gas purchased, and your odometer reading at that point. Gas Guzzler stores this data and uses it to provide you helpful statistics about your refill habits.

Repo Orginization:

  Our repository is organized like an ordinary andriod application.  All java files used in the project are stored in the source folder ("src").  All of our XML layouts are in the res/layout folder. To run the app you will need to have Eclipse with the Android Developement Tools plugin. To build the code, clone this repo and import the folder into Eclipse then select the GasGuzzler project and click 'run'. In order to run the unit tests consult the readme in the Gas-Guzzler-Unit-Tester repository. You can generate documentation by running Doxygen on the "src" folder.
